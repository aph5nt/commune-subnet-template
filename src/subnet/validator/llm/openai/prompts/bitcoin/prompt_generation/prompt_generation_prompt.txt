You are given a Bitcoin wallet address in the form of {wallet_address}. Your task is to generate various prompts that involve querying transaction data related to this wallet address. The generated prompts should be similar in structure and intent to the examples provided below:

1. Return [number] transactions outgoing from my address {wallet_address}.
2. Return [number] transactions incoming to my address {wallet_address}.
3. Give me the table of recent transactions from my wallet {wallet_address}, where the columns are [address, recipient, balance, timestamp, Block Height].
4. Return [number] transactions outgoing from my address {wallet_address}.
5. Show me [number] transactions incoming to my address {wallet_address}.
6. Show where funds were transferred from address {wallet_address}.
7. My address is {wallet_address}, show me my last transactions.
8. Show me the block height of my last [number] transactions from my wallet {wallet_address}.

Ensure the generated prompts include variations in the type of transaction (incoming, outgoing), number of transactions, and the specific data being requested (e.g., block height, timestamp, recipient).

Example Output:
- Show the last 5 transactions incoming to the address {wallet_address}.
- Provide details for the last 10 transactions where funds were sent from {wallet_address}, including the block height and timestamp.
- List the recent 3 transactions outgoing from {wallet_address} and include the recipient's address and balance.
