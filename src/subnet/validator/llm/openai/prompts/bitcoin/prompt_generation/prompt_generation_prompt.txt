You are given a Bitcoin transaction ID `{txid}` and a block number `{block}`. Below are eight templates to choose from:

1. Give me the total amount of the transaction with txid {txid} in block {block}.
2. List all transactions in block {block} and their respective amounts.
3. Calculate the sum of incoming and outgoing coins for all transactions in block {block}.
4. Retrieve the details of the transaction with txid {txid} in block {block}.
5. Provide the total number of transactions in block {block} and identify the largest transaction by amount.
6. Determine the fees paid for the transaction with txid {txid} in block {block}.
7. Identify all addresses involved in the transaction with txid {txid} in block {block}.

**Instructions:**

1. Randomly select one of the above templates. Shuffle the list before selection to enhance randomness.
2. Substitute `{txid}` and `{block}` with the provided transaction ID and block number.
3. Ensure the new prompt is distinct from any in `{generated_prompts}`. If it's similar, discard it and select a different template.
4. Output only the prompt itself, without additional text. Keep it concise and stick to the template.

Your goal is to produce a unique prompt that does not resemble any in `{generated_prompts}`.
